# csgo-mac

Native Apple Silicon support for [Kisak-Strike](https://github.com/SwagSoftware/Kisak-Strike), the open-source CS:GO engine port.

The macOS build runs as arm64 code without Rosetta. It can start without the Steam desktop client and supports insecure offline/LAN play. Steam matchmaking, VAC, inventory, achievements, and other online Steam services are not available in standalone mode.

See [MACOS.md](MACOS.md) for the Apple Silicon build and launch instructions. Original game assets are not included in this repository.

Kisak-Strike: Gentoo Offensive(KSGO) is a CSGO port aimed towards Linux enthusiasts. 

It can be built 100% Open-Source with optional Closed-source components.

# Current Building Steps

```
Attention!

Kisak-Strike will build into folder ../game/
Make sure you clone this repo inside an existing folder!
```

Kisak-Strike uses CMake, the following sections will provide more information.

## Packages
SDL2 SDL2_mixer tcmalloc_minimal rt openal curl ssl z crypto dl pthread fontconfig freetype GL

#### Ubuntu 
```
sudo apt install git build-essential cmake ninja-build libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-dev libopenal-dev libssl-dev libfontconfig1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libglu1-mesa-dev net-tools
```
#### Fedora
```
sudo dnf install git SDL2-devel SDL2_mixer-devel gperftools-devel openal-soft-devel libcurl-devel openssl-devel fontconfig-devel freetype-devel cmake gcc g++ mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libGLU-devel
```
#### Arch
```
sdl2 sdl2_mixer gperftools openal libcurl-compat openssl fontconfig freetype2 mesa cmake gcc base-devel
```

#### Gentoo
```
media-libs/libsdl2 media-libs/sdl2-mixer dev-util/google-perftools media-libs/openal net-misc/curl dev-libs/openssl media-libs/fontconfig media-libs/freetype media-libs/mesa dev-util/cmake sys-devel/gcc
```

## BUILD - cmake/make
See the wiki page for building options: https://github.com/SwagSoftware/Kisak-Strike/wiki/CMake

 #### Basic Usage
```
cd ./cmake-build
cmake .. <VARIOUS OPTIONS HERE>
make -j<NUM_THREADS>
```
CI builds with `-DUSE_KISAK_PHYSICS=ON`. Release binaries target `-march=x86-64-v2` so they run on CPUs other than the build host; add `-DKISAK_ARCH_FLAGS=-march=native` to tune for your own machine, or `-DRELEASE_DEBUG_INFO=OFF` to leave out the debug info that Release builds otherwise keep.
## POSTBUILD - Acquire Original Game Files
Use Depot Downloader( https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader ) with your steam account. The depotdownloader built-into Steam was broken earlier this year and this is the only option currently.
```
CSGO SteamAppID: 730
CSGO Assets: DepotID: 731 ManifestID: 7043469183016184477
Windows Binaries: DepotID: 732 4047004309608881181
Linux Binaries: Depot ID: 734 4197642562793798650
```

* Copy over all files from the 731 assets depot (manifest: 7043469183016184477)
* Copy over *only needed* files from the 734 linux binary depot (manifest: 4197642562793798650)
    * ./bin/map_publish/* - (FOLDER which seems to contain some vgui assets)
    * ./csgo.sh
    * [OPTIONAL]./game/bin/linux64/libphonon3d.so -- If you want HRTF 3D sound. Copy it before configuring with `-DUSE_VALVE_HRTF=ON`, which links against it.
    * [OPTIONAL]./game/bin/linux64/vphysics_client.so -- If you want Valve-Original physics engine. (It runs a bit better than the rebuild, but is closed-source)
    * [OPTIONAL]./game/bin/linux64/scaleformui_client.so -- If you want the ScaleformUI for some reason.

## POSTBUILD - Acquire Additional Kisak-Strike Files
Head over to the Files Repo: https://github.com/SwagSoftware/Kisak-Strike-Files
These belong inside of your `../game/` folder.


## Current Nonfree blobs
* ${LIBPUBLIC}/libsteam_api.so  - Left for Convenience, can be removed in the future.

## Launch
`./csgo_linux64`
